### Project Summary

Our project focuses on helping our users to develop healthy eating habits by tracking their calories, protein, carbohydrates, and fibre’s intake based on their Body Mass Index (BMI) and Body Metabolic Rate (BMR) with a guided 3-step process. The database that we are going to use for this project is “https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md-bhnrc/beltsville-human-nutrition-research-center/food-surveys-research-group/docs/fndds-download-databases/.” This database includes Food Name, Carbohydrates, Protein, and Fiber, which are all the information needed to provide our users a suggested amount of calories and nutrients intake (Step 1).

The user then will be able to search on the ingredients they want and will be provided the calories and nutrients content for each ingredient. We will also include filters such as calories range, protein, carbohydrates, fiber content on ingredients to ease the process of searching. We will provide them with an interactive calculator, so that the user can mix and match their ingredients while seeing how it adds up to their total goal of calories (Step 2). Lastly, the user will be able to see the summary of the total calories and nutrients of the ingredients they have chosen (Step 3).
